== Executables
Yubicommons supports building stand alone executables using PyInstaller, for
distribution on Windows and OS X. Executables are build for any entry_points
defined in your projects setup.py.

To create the binaries, run the following command:

 $ python setup.py executable

To make the command available, you must include it in your projects setup.py.
You should also specify the *long_name* parameter in addition to *name*, for
giving the application a more human readable name.

=== Example setup.py snippet
    from yubicommon.setup import setup
    from yubicommon.setup.exe import executable

    setup(
        name='yubioath-desktop',
        long_name='Yubico Authenticator',
        cmdclass={
            'executable': executable
        },
        entry_points={
            'gui_scripts': ['yubioath=yubioath.gui.__main__:main'],
            'console_scripts': ['yubioath-cli=yubioath.cli.__main__:main']
        },
        ...
    )

NOTE: Only entries in *console_scripts* will have their output shown in a
terminal.

== Including files
Often you will need to include additional files such as DLLs in your
installation directory. This can be done by creating a *lib/* directory in the
root of the project and adding any files there. These files will simply be
copied to the root of the output directory.
